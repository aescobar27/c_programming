/*  A program using a while loop, that compares the approximation
              Capprox = (F - 30)/2
    for the conversion of Fahrenheit(F) to Centigrade(C), with the more familiar version:
              C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9
    The program compares Capprox against C, for different values of F, and finishes when the
    difference between C and Capprox is greater than or equal to 4.0. 
    Finally, the program prints out the value of F when the condition is met.
