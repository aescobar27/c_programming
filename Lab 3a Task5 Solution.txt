/* Lab 3a Task5 Solution
      Write a simple program that tests whether a given integer is between the limits 0 and 100, as follows:
      a) Prompts the user to enter any number, positive or negative. Save the number entered.
      b) Tests whether the number entered is between the limits, or not, using a single if statement using
         the logical and operator.
      c) Print out whether the number entered is less than, or greater than 0 and 100, or is between them.
      d) Tests whether the number entered is between the limits using a SINGLE if statement using
         the logical OR operator.
