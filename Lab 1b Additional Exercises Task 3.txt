/* A ball is released from a height of 20 metres above the ground with an 
   initial velocity of 0 m/s. Using the following formulae:
           s = ut + at*t/2
           v = u + at
   where s is distance (m), t is time (s), u is initial velocity (m/s) and v is final velocity (m/s),
   write a program that calculates
   (i)  The time it takes the ball to hit the ground from the moment it is released.
   (ii) The speed at which the ball collides with the ground.
