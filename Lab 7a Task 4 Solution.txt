/* This program uses a function called avg_sum that calculates the sum and average 
   of a set of five floating point numbers. The function has the following prototype:
		void avg_sum (double a[ ], int n, double *avg, double *sum);

   The program first prompts the user for five numbers (doubles) and stores them in an array; 
   the array is then passed to avg_sum from which it calculates the sum and average.
