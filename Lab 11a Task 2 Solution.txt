   To toggle a bit in a variable i, apply the exclusive-or operator (^) to i and a
   mask with a 1 bit in the desired position, then store the result back into i.
   
   To toggle bit 4, for example, use the statement
                   i = i ^ 0x0010;
   or, more concisely,
                   i ^= 0x0010;
