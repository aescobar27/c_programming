   Complete the following:
   (a) Declare main so that it can access command line arguments.
   (b) Check that there are three command line arguments, and if not,
       exit with the message "usage: check filename".
   (c) Try to open the first file name given on the command line. If file can't be 
       opened print the message "Can't open <filename> and exit,
       else print "<filename1> opened successfully!" 
   (d) Try to open the second file name given on the command line.  If file can't be
       opened print the message "Can't open <filename> and exit,
       else print "<filename2> opened successfully!"
   (e) If both filenames can be opened, copy filename1 to filename2, and print
       "File copied successfully."
   (f) Close both files.
